## Description

This project was my semester assignment for Christmas, designed to showcase what we have learned in design, HTML, and CSS. The project began with planning in Figma before transitioning to the coding process. The task was to create a website aimed at the 6-16 age group. It needed to be easy to navigate and highlight exciting events. We were provided with images, but we optimized them ourselves. I chose to use SVGs to create a more playful design.
